This is a personalized app to showcase what I have done and is able to accomplish.
To run, open visual studio code and have expo installed using command 'npm install' and start app using command 'npm start --reset-cache'
Once app is running, you are able to scan the qr code in the terminal section and open on any mobile device or tablet.

Currently, all the infomation and code is stored within the files but will have the information stored within a secured database once I have AWS functional
